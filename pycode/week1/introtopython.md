# Python
Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants, on the Mac, and on Windows 2000 and later.

## Create a few variables (which can be a function of an)
### defining variables
```
variable = "I want to learn Python"              
another_variable = 42
```

### using basic math
```
yet_another_variable = another_variable*6
```

### using more advanced math
```
from math import sqrt
and_another_variable_still = sqrt(yet_another_variable)
```

## Extension packages
Python already has a lot of functionality built in, but there are now more than 200,000 extension packages in the official [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/)

## Cheat sheets
There are many cheatsheets on the internet, some specialised to particular uses of python. A good generic one comes from [Python Crash Course](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_2e/cheat_sheets/cheat_sheets/)

## Working with data in Python
The easiest way of getting data into Python is to use text files, such as .csv files, though you can also connect to databases, read in more specialised file formats such as XML or netcdf.
